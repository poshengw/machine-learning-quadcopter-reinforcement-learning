## Project: Train a Quadcopter How to Fly

### Problem Statement
1. Design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm.
2. Define the task and design a reinforcement learning agent.
3. The Task
4. The Agent
5. Policy to compute the action
6. DDPG 
7. Average reward obtained from each episode, it keeps tracking the best parameters found so far.  
8. to build in a mechanism to log/save the total rewards obtained in each episode to file. If the episode rewards are gradually increasing, this is an indication that your agent is learning.

9. This is a taking off task for quadcopter. The goal is to reach the height of 100 from the starting point
10. Initial the DDPG object that contains the Actor and Critic
